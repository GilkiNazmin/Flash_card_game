# French Flash Card Game 🇫🇷🃏

Welcome to my French Flash Card Game project! This is part of my journey through the #100DaysOfCoding challenge on Udemy.

## About the Project

This project is a simple yet effective way to enhance French language learning through interactive flashcards. The game presents a French word, flips the card after 3 seconds, and prompts the user to click the green button if they knew the English translation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Learning:** The game tracks words that the user struggles with and saves them to a `word_to_learn.csv` file for focused practice.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and intuitive design for an engaging learning experience.
- **Progress Tracking:** Easily monitor your learning progress and revisit challenging words.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GilkiNazmin/Flash_card_game.git
2.Run the game.
